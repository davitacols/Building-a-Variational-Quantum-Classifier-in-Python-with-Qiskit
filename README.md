## Overview

### What is a Variational Quantum Classifier?

A VQC leverages the power of quantum computers to process input data via parameterized quantum circuits. It uses a classical optimizer to iteratively adjust the quantum circuit's parameters to minimize a cost function (e.g., binary cross-entropy or mean squared error). VQCs are particularly promising for tasks in quantum machine learning, such as binary or multiclass classification.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQC)**: The quantum circuit with trainable parameters.
- **Hybrid Optimization**: A classical optimizer (e.g., COBYLA or L-BFGS-B) is used to minimize a cost function based on quantum measurements.
- **Quantum Feature Encoding**: Input data is encoded into the quantum state via rotations or other transformations.
- **Quantum Measurement**: Measurements of quantum states provide the predicted classification probabilities.

## Requirements

### Python Version:
- Python 3.8 or higher

### Required Libraries:
- Qiskit: For quantum circuit design and simulation
- SciPy: For classical optimization
- NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical operations

You can install all required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install qiskit scipy numpy
```

## Features
- **Quantum Data Encoding**: Encodes classical data into quantum states using feature maps.
- **Customizable Ansatz**: Uses the RyRz ansatz as the parameterized circuit, with options for entangling gates.
- **Cost Function for Classification**: Implements a binary cross-entropy loss function.
- **Hybrid Optimization**: Combines quantum circuit evaluation with classical optimization to train the model.
- **Simulator Support**: Uses Qiskit's Aer simulator to execute quantum circuits.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/variational-quantum-classifier.git
cd variational-quantum-classifier
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the script:
```bash
python vqc_classifier.py
```

## How It Works

### Key Steps:

#### 1. Data Preparation:
- Input data (e.g., binary classification labels) is normalized and mapped to a quantum feature space.

#### 2. Quantum Circuit Design:
- The RyRz ansatz is used as the parameterized quantum circuit. This circuit applies parameterized single-qubit rotations (RY, RZ) followed by entangling CNOT gates.

#### 3. Cost Function Definition:
- The cost function is defined to quantify the error in classification. Binary cross-entropy is commonly used.

#### 4. Hybrid Optimization:
- A classical optimizer (e.g., L-BFGS-B, COBYLA) adjusts the circuit's parameters to minimize the cost function.

#### 5. Model Evaluation:
- Once trained, the model predicts labels for unseen data by evaluating the quantum circuit with optimized parameters.

## Usage

### Data Definition:
Prepare a dataset with features and labels. For simplicity, the script supports synthetic datasets generated using NumPy.

```python
# Example: Simple binary classification dataset
features = np.array([[0.1, 0.2], [0.9, 0.8], [0.4, 0.5]])
labels = np.array([0, 1, 0])  # Binary labels
```

### Run the Script:
Execute the training and evaluation pipeline by running the script:

```bash
python vqc_classifier.py
```

### Key Output:
- Optimized parameters of the quantum circuit
- Training accuracy
- Classification results on a test dataset

## Results

### Example Output:
For a simple binary classification dataset:

```yaml
Training Accuracy: 95.0%
Test Accuracy: 90.0%
Optimized Parameters:
 [2.345, 1.234, 3.567, ...]
Predicted Labels: [0, 1, 0]
```

### Visualization:
Add a visualization to show decision boundaries or loss convergence during training.
